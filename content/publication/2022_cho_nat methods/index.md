abstract: Engineered cardiac tissues derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells offer unique opportunities for patient-specific disease modeling, drug discovery and cardiac repair. Since the first engineered hearts were introduced over two decades ago, human induced pluripotent stem cell-based three-dimensional cardiac organoids and heart-on-a-chip systems have now become mainstays in basic cardiovascular research as valuable platforms for investigating fundamental human pathophysiology and development. However, major obstacles remain to be addressed before the field can truly advance toward commercial and clinical translation. Here we provide a snapshot of the state-of-the-art methods in cardiac tissue engineering, with a focus on in vitro models of the human heart. Looking ahead, we discuss major challenges and opportunities in the field and suggest strategies for enabling broad acceptance of engineered cardiac tissues as models of cardiac pathophysiology and testbeds for the development of therapies.
